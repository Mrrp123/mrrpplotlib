# MrrpPlotLib
This repo contains code for creating 'histerr' plots (Just histogram plots with errorbars). I utilize these plots a lot so
I made this repo to make my life easier. Feel free to use them yourself however you want. No guarantees on things not being jank.

# How to Install
This project doesn't exist on PyPi (for now), to install, you should just be able to do
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Mrrp123/mrrpplotlib.git
```
And hopefully everything just works&trade;
